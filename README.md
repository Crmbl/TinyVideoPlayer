# TinyVideoPlayer
A tiny video player with a simple design.

* Buttons on top/right/bottom to handle the video
* Right click on the player to drag it around the screen
* ThumbButtons on taskbar to toggle play/pause or topmost on/off
* Double click to toggle play/pause
* Zoom feature 
* Resizable
* Search and play Youtube videos ...

The search feature has some flaws, better use your mouse to select item.
It needs an ApiKey => https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/ then paste your key in a "apiKey" file inside bin/Release folder.

Use Vlc.DotNet
